The purpose of this project is to use ember to create an interface where you can monitor different social media in a single dashboard.
The plan is to support youtube, twitter and facebook. Currently due to limited time I am only supporting youtube and twitter using their public API.

You can add search terms just like in respective social media and you can get the results and toggle between differnt panels to compare and monitors.


This application could be particularly useful for someone on social media marketing etc where they need to constantly keep track of trending topics aand specific buzz words.

The file structure here is a little weird because I wanted to host the static rack on heroku.

Here is a hosted link for the demo:
